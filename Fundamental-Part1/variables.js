// Output a message to the console
console.log('JavaScript is amazing');

// A value is the smallest unit of information in JavaScript. For example, 'JavaScript is amazing' is a value.
// We can store a value in a variable, which acts like a box for storing and reusing the value.

// Example of a variable:
let js = 'JavaScript is amazing';
// 'js' is a variable, and now we can use the 'js' variable throughout our code.
console.log(js);

/* Naming conventions and rules for variables:
   1. Use camelCase for variable names, like firstNameOfUser.
   2. Do not start variable names with a capital letter, e.g., avoid using Person.
   3. If a variable's value will never change, use all uppercase letters, e.g., let PI = 3.14.
   4. Choose descriptive variable names; for example, let myFirstJob is better than job1.

   Rules:
   1. Cannot start a variable name with a number, e.g., let 3years - ERROR.
   2. Variables can only contain alphanumeric characters, underscores, and dollar ($) signs.
      Anything else is not allowed. For example, let jonas$matida - ERROR.
      Instead, use let jonas_matida.
   3. Avoid using reserved keywords like function, let, and const as variable names.
   4. The 'name' keyword does not give an error, but it's best to avoid using it.

// Example of using uppercase for a constant value:
const PI = 3.14;
console.log(PI);
